Shape Up is the book written by [Ryan Singer](https://world.hey.com/rjs). It is a product development methodology.

> Shape Up is for product development teams who struggle to ship. If you've thought to yourself _"Why can't we ship like we used to?"_ or _"I never have enough time to think about strategy"_ then this book can help.

## Read the book first

This series of articles shares my thoughts on the implementation of Shape Up. Based on my past experiences as a software developer, project manager, scrum master, product owner and engineering manager. I do not provide the perfect recipe for your company but may inspire you and highlight the challenges upfront. I also mention techniques from the other frameworks/methods you may try to apply within Shape Up

As I want to extend the topic, I try not to repeat the book. 

[__Please read the book first__](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) - it is free, short, essential and pleasant to read.
