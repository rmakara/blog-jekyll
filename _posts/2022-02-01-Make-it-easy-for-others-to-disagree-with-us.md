When we speak publicly, we add _“in my opinion/context/experience”_ statements. It blocks others from disagreeing with us. Our image remains safe. At some point, this statement becomes painful to listen to.

Let's say it works for _"non-real-work"_ or _"brainstorming"_ or _"discussions"_. However, it provides quite a low value for _"decisions"_.

In decision-making process, we want to make it easy for others to disagree with us.

We want more of _“Given the facts ... I see pros/opportunities ... and cons/risks ..., I make the following assumptions ... I bet the best step is to ...”_, which looks like [RFC doc (Request For Comments)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/).

Then, consider silence as disagreement.

Then, we may experiment with a bet and succeed or fail.
