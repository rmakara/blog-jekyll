# Seniority formula

# Focus on the right thing

# Calling to UX Designers

Information architecture and interaction design. Less visual design. Validate ideas.

# Calling to Software Developers

Stop coding.

# Calling to Testers

Shift left on security.

# Calling to Scrum Masters

Take programming course to be able to remove impediments.

Process becomes an impediment.

# Calling to Project Managers

Cutting half of engineering value.

Become delivery manager.

Sense of urgency.

Impediment remover not a proxy.

# Your seniory is a lie

Product manager is a poor ux and pm

# Team's versatility is the new North Star

Some teams make the big mistake of measuring engineers by one yardstick and product managers by another.  This shows up as a common problem with OKR’s, where the engineers have one set of quarterly objectives and key results, and the product managers another.  This is exactly the wrong approach for product teams.  The team needs to be exactly aligned in terms of their work.

# Stop being senior, start being junior
